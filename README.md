# LetsVenture Take Home Challenge


## Guidelines

-   This is meant to be an assignment that you spend approximately three hours of dedicated, focused work. Do not feel like you need to overengineer the solution with dozens of hours to impress us. Be biased toward quality over quantity.

-  Create a repo on Github, use git for source control, and use README.md to document what you built for the newcomer to your project.

-   Please organize, design, test, deploy, and document your solution as if you were going to put into production. We completely understand this might mean you can't do as much in the time budget. Be biased for production-ready over features.

-   Think out loud in your submission's documentation. Document tradeoffs, the rationale behind your technical choices, or things you would do or do differently if you were able to spend more time on the project or do it again.

-  Make sure to document how to get started with your solution in terms of setup.

## The Problem

San Francisco loves to eat. They also love variety, so they also like to discover new places to eat.

In fact, they have a particular affection for food trucks. One of the great things about Food Trucks in San Francisco is that the city releases a list of them as open data.

Your assignment is to make it possible to find a food truck no matter where our work takes us in the city.

Weite a web frontend that visualizes the nearby food trucks using React (You can use the below CSV as your source data).

The only requirement for the assignment is that it give us at least 5 food trucks to choose from a particular latitude and longitude.

San Francisco's food truck open dataset is [located here](https://data.sfgov.org/Economy-and-Community/Mobile-Food-Facility-Permit/rqzj-sfat/data) and there is an endpoint with a [CSV dump of the latest data here](https://data.sfgov.org/api/views/rqzj-sfat/rows.csv). We've included a [copy of this data](./Mobile_Food_Facility_Permit.csv) in this repo as well.

Good luck! Please send a link to your solution on Github back to us at least 12 hours before your interview so we can review it before we speak.
